# 👋 Hey, I'm Rawoof!

🔥 Machine Learning & Deep Learning Engineer  
⚙️ Mechanical Engineer who fell in love with AI  
🧠 Curious mind — if something interests me, I go *all the way* into it

---

## 🚀 Who Am I?

I’m the type of person who sees something interesting…  
and suddenly I’m 3 hours deep into docs, experiments, and debugging 😄  

I love building things that:
- Learn
- Adapt
- Make life easier

Right now, I work on ML/DL projects and explore anything that sparks curiosity —  
from federated learning to AI chatbots to running OS experiments on random devices.

## 🧠 What I Love Working On

### ✨ Machine Learning & Deep Learning
- CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs  
- Transformers (BERT, RoBERTa, ViT – currently learning 🚀)  
- Classification, Prediction, Anomaly Detection  
- Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering (yes, I actually enjoy it 😄)  
- **Latest Technologies**
  - Vision Transformers (ViT)
  - Generative AI (LLMs, ChatGPT fine-tuning concepts)
  - Federated Learning
  - MLOps basics (model versioning, pipelines, reproducibility)
  - ONNX & model optimization
  - Transfer Learning (EfficientNet, ResNet, MobileNet)
  - TinyML

### **⚙️ Engineering + Problem Solving**
- Thinking like an engineer  
- Breaking problems into systems  
- Automating anything that feels repetitive

### **💡 Things I randomly deep-dive into**
- Robotics integration  
- Lightweight OS experiments  
- Building AI tools with minimal hardware  
- Emotion-aware chatbots  
- Federated learning prototypes

## 📂 My Projects (More Coming 🔧)
- 😄 Emotion Detection + Chatbot (BERT + GPT)
- 🧠 Helmet Detection (YOLOv8 + DeepSORT)
- 🗣️ Customer Feedback Analyzer (BERT + LDA / BERTopic)
- ☀️ Solar Energy Forecasting (LSTM / TFT)
- 🧬 Genomic Variant Classification (1D CNN + Transformer)
- 🎥 Movie Recommendation System (Hybrid + MLOps)

*(I upload things when they feel “good enough” — perfectionist problems)*
